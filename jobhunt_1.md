# Job Hunt

- Look at a week on week average of how many jobs you applied for...

## TIPS

- Stick to a routine (Wake up 7:00am, shower, get dressed, have breakfast, start working at 9:30am)
- Double down on learning, ensures you are confident with the language. 
- 2 or 3 applications a week is fine. 
- **Keep coding! Build build build! (Active learning over passive learning)** 
- Log all contact with companies (including networking, coffee dates etc) Use a blog!!!!
- Build over learning 
- For CV talk mostly about the tech not about previous non tech experience

## To Do 

- Create a careers channel 
- Sign up for huntr 
- Friday feedback (weekly check-in)
