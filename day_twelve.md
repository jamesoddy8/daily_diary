### The Web Â 

The whole web is built on client-server relationships. There are different kinds of clients and servers but the relationship is roughly the same: the client is dependent on the server for providing and managing information. Anything that can request a resource from a server can be called a client.

Challenge - setup using httpie 
``` brew install httpie ```

### The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

Usually, clients and servers talk to each other using the HyperText Transfer Protocol. A client makes a request to a server and gets back a response. It is called a "protocol" because it has a defined structure for requests and responses.

#### URLs

At the heart of web communications is the request message, which are sent via Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).

```http://www.domain.com:1234/path/to/resource?a=b&x=y```

http = protocol 
www.domain.com = host 
1234 = port 
path/to/resource = resource path 
?a=b%x=y = query 

### HTTP: Parameters

Within HTTP, we call data sent from a client to a server a parameter. Just like Ruby's hashes, parameters come as key-value pairs and a request can contain multiple parameters. One way of sending a parameter to a server is to pass it in the query string. The query string is a string that can be appended to an URL. It has a special set of formatting conventions.
