similar to a triage .. 

symptoms of the problem -> possible causes -> start with the most common problem first 

### Tips on sinatra debugging

#### Tighten the loop

- Type the rspec error out indivdually e.g rspec ./spec/features/flipped_struggle_spec.rb:9
- Picked a unit test first
- Look at the stacktrace to find the specific file

#### Get visibility

- Use the website sinatra error log to find errors 
- Read the test file
- Read the error (expected & actual) 
- Tried an idea to see & error changes
- Look at the errors on the website 

### srand (number = Random.new_seed)

First number is random, second time is the number you entered. srand 1234 => 219308129038120938210, srand 1234 => 1234

srand may be used to ensure repeatable sequences of pseudo-random numbers between different runs of the program. By setting the seed to a known value, programs can be made deterministic during testing.
