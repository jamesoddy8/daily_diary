# Creating a back end app with JavaScript 

### Data Types

In JavaScript there are seven fundamental data types: 

1. *Number*: Any numbers including numbers with decimals 
2. *String*: Any grouping characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc) surrounded by single or double quotes. Though we prefer single quotes.
3. *Boolean*: This data type only has two possible values either true or false. Booleans are bascially on and off switches. 
4. *Null*: This data type represents the intentional absence of a value and is reprented by the keyword null. 
5. *Undefined*: This data type is denoted by the keyword ```undefined```. It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than ```null```.
6. *Symbol*: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. 
7. *Object*: Collection of related data.
