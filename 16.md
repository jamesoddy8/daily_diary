# Monday 9th March - Week 4

## Code review

### Testing infrastructure 

Instead of 

```ruby 
feature 'Testing infrastructure' do
  scenario 'Can run app and check page content' do
    visit('/')
    expect(page).to have_content 'Testing infrastructure working!'
  end
end
```

Use the following. This can then be left inside the text without having to comment it out...


```ruby
feature 'testing infrastructure' do
  scenario 'testing framework is set up correctly' do
    visit ('/test')
    expect(page).to have_content "Testing"
  end
end
```

By the end of the week all developers can: 

- Build a simple web app with a database
- Follow an effective debugging process for atabase applications
- Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)

## SQL 
Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used in programming are designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDSMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structural data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables. 

Create, Read, Update & Delete aka CRUD

REST 

- POST = Create
- GET = Read 
- PUT/POST/PATCH = Update
- POST with header (DELETE) DELETE = Delete 

## SQL zoo 
```
SELECT (population)
FROM (world)
WHERE (name = 'Germany') 
```
Strings (pieces of text that are data should be in 'single quotes') 
```
SELECT name, population 
FROM world
WHERE name 
IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark');
```
For checking a list, the word IN allows us to check if an item is in a list. 
```
SELECT name, area 
FROM world
WHERE area 
BETWEEN 250000 AND 300000
```
BETWEEN allows range checking (range specified is inclusive of boundary values). Note that this is inclusive. 

### WHERE filters
```
SELECT name, population/area 
FROM bbc
WHERE area > 5000000
```
We can use mathematical and string expressions as well as field names and constants. 
```
SELECT name , region
FROM bbc
WHERE area < 2000
AND gdp > 5000000000
```
We use AND to ensure that two or more conditions hold true. 
```
SELECT name 
FROM bbc
WHERE name 
IN ('Sri Lanka', 'Ceylon', 'Persia', 'Iran')
```
The word IN allows us to check if an item is in a list.
```
SELECT name 
FROM bbc
WHERE name 
LIKE 'D%'
```
The word ```LIKE``` permits pattern matching - % is the wildcard.
We can use % at the beginning or at the end of the word. For example words that start with 'a' would be 'a%' whereas words ending with 'a' would be '%a'.
