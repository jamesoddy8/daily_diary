# JS / jquery / html 

When you are naming methods, make sure the name for the methods is the same throughout the js/html and jquery.js otherwise they will not link and will not show up on the webpage. 

# Javascript Closures

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the **lexical environment**). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time. 

## Lexical scoping

Consider the following example code: 

```js 

function init() {
  var name = 'Mozilla'; // name is a local variable created by init
  function displayName() { // displayName() is the inner function, a closure
     alert(name); // use variable declred in the parent function
   }
  displayName();
} 
init();
```

```init()```creates a local variable called ```name``` and a function called ```displayName()```. The ```displayName()``` function is an inner function that is defined inside ```init()``` and is available only within the body of the ```init()``` function. Note that the ```displayName()``` function has no local variable of its own. However, since inner function have access to the variables of outer functions, ```displayName()``` can access the variable ```name``` declared in the parent function, ```init()```.
