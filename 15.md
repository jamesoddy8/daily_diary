## Static files
 
Earlier we have linked to an external image in our HTML. This is fine but it would be so much nicer to have the image as part of our project. This would be a **static assett**, let's see how Sinatra handles them. 

Let's put our image into **public/images/kitten.png** file in our project. The **public** folder doesn't exist, so create it as well as the images folder inside it. Now our file structure looks like this: 

``` sinatra/public/images/kitten.png ```
