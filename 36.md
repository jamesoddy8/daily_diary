## Chitter API Front End Challenge

### Introduction to web APIs

#### What are APIs?

**Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** are constructs made available in programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily. They abstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place. 

As a real-world example, think about the electricity supply in your house, apartment or other dwelling. If you want to use an apopliance in your house, you simply plug it into a plug socket and it works. You don't try to wire it directly into the power supply - to do so would be really inefficient and, if you are not an electrician, difficult and dangerous to attempt. 

In the same way, if you want to say, program some 3D graphics, it is a lot easier to do it using an API written in a higher-level language such as JavaScript or Python, rather than try to directly write low level code (say C or C++) directly controls the computer's GPU or other graphics functions. 

#### APIs in client-side JavaScript

Client-side JS, in particular, has many APIs available to it - these are not part of the JS language itself, rather they are built on top of the core JS language, providing you with extra superpowers to use in your JS code. They generally fall into two categories: 

- **Browser APIs** are built into your web browser and are able to expose data from the browser and surrounding computer environment and do useful complex things with it. For example, the Web Audio API provides JS constructs for manipulating audio in the browser - taking an audio track, altering its volume, applying effects to it, etc. In the background, the browser is actually using some complex lower-level code (e.g. C++ or Rust) to do the actual audio processing. But again, this complexity is abstracted away from you by the API. 
- **Third-party APIs** are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to retrieve their code and information from somewhere on the Web. For example,
