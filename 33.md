# Module Pattern

Objectives: 

- describe what module pattern does?

- how it works?

- write code using module pattern

IFFY 
```js
(function() {
console.log("Hi!"
})()
```
-> Hi!

to define scope - make things private
```js
(function() {

    const NUM_EXCLAMATIONS = 5
    
    function sayHi(string) {
        return string +"!".repeat(NUM_EXCLAMATIONS) 
        }
    console.log(sayHi("Hi")) 
})()
```
wrapped in parenthesis for compilation 

-> Hi!!!!!

ALL CAPS for constants 

console.log(NUM_EXCLAMATIONS)
-> ERROR
console.log(sayHi("Hi"))
-> ERROR

protects the inside of a code from being accessed

reason why we use module patterns is if we want to resuse a part of the IFFY

for example - accessing sayHi within the IFFY
```js
(function(exports) {

    const NUM_EXCLAMATIONS = 5
    
    function sayHi(string) {
        return string + "!".repeat(NUM_EXCLAMATIONS)
    }
    exports.sayHi = sayHi
})(this)
```
-> undefined 
console.log(sayHi("Hi")
-> Hi!!!!!
console.log(NUM_EXCLAMATIONS) is this still private??
-> ERROR 

1. How does the function that wraps the question module keep QUESTION_MARK_COUNT private? Why is this useful?

2. How does the pattern used in the question and exclaim modules differ from the pattern used in the interrobang module? Why are different patterns used?

Interobang using callback - one of the most JS things 

3. Can you predict and confirm the value of this in all the parts of each module?

window refers to JS code
document refers to what is being displayed on the screen
