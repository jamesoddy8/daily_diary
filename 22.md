## Jasmine

jasmine.createSpy can be used when there is no function to spy on. It will track calls and arguments like a spyOn but there is no implementation.

jasmine.createSpyObj is used to create a mock that will spy on one or more methods. It returns an object that has a property for each string that is a spy.
