# What is Markdown? #

Markdown is a formatting syntax that allows you to write in plain text in any editing program, but still format your document like you would with a word processor. It was created to convert plain text into HTML for publishing on the web and happens to be super easy to write and just as easy to read even without being converted. 

Markdown ensures that a writer's intended formatting never gets lost. If you've ever laboured on a Word document only to have its formatting scrambled when you sent it to be published to your website or when a collegue opened it in another program, you'll appreciate the simplicity and stablity of Markdown. 

While you can edit Markdown files in any text editor, there are some, like iA Writer for Macs, that are specifically built to make this easy way of writing even easier. 

# How do I write in Markdown? #

Markdown is extremely simple. In fact, it's mostly plain text, so writing a paragraph would be the same as with any text editor (there's a line between each paragraph). 

If you want to put in a line break  
you merely put two spaces after a line  
and it shows up like this.

## Emphasis ##

If you want to make a word **bold**, you merely put two asterisks around it:

```like **this** ```

If you want to put text inside a grey box you use 3 tildes ~ or backticks ` on a line before and after the text. 

```like this```

To emphasise a word with *italics* you put one asterisk around it: 

```like *this*```

or

```use an _underscore_``` to get the _same results_

_You can even use these same characters to emphasise complete sentences_

## Links ##Â 

Links are simple. Just put the text to be linke in [] brackets, and the link in () parenthesis.

## Blockquotes ##

> When typing an extended quote, just put the "greater than" sign before the paragraph. 

```>"I have dipped into books of aesthetics, but I had an uncomfortable feeling that I was reading the works of atronomers who had never looked at the stars. They were writing about poetry as if poetry were a task, and not what it really is, a passion, and a joy."```
