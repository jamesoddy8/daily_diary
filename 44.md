# Workshop Tech CV Writing 

- Be careful with recruitment companies

- Job hunting strategy excel sheet

- Take some time to make a huge list at the beginning of the week of companies to apply to & then work your way through the list alongside coding

- Group work - someone keeping time, project manager & nominated/volunteered to feedback at the end of the task

- 30K and above is what Makers careers expect

- too small a company can be bad - less people to help teach you - more reliant on you for work you are not prepared for 
- larger companies can be beneficial - more people to take up slack 

ADVICE 

- Need a mentor
- & a good salary 

- Approach companies who do not have a job going
- Use Linkedin - look at people - look at their experience - make friends with CTO/HR/ - what can I do or build to be someone you would like to hire? 
- if there's no job going but they offer something - use that to get in and then step up through (providing it's somewhere you really want to work)

- if you are not having responses on linkedin - pick up the phone too - gives a personal impression 

- Thought Machine

- Use github to research their repositories... e.g. github + thought machine - fix an issue they have - include it on your CV
/phone call etc...
