## JavaScript Arrow Functions: How, why and when (and when not) to use them

Arrow functions - sometimes called 'fat arrow' functions, utlize the token ```=>```.

JavaScript arrow functions are roughly the equivalent of blocks in Ruby. 

An arrown function expression is a syntactically compact alternative to a regular function expression, although without its oven bindings to the ```this```, ```arguments```, ```super```, or ```new.target``` keywords. Arrow function expressions are ill suited as methods, and they cannot be used as constructors. 

**Arrow Function Syntax** 

 

> Ruby reminder - A block is a piece of code that accepts arguments, and returns a value. A block is always passed to a method call.

```ruby
5.times do
  puts "Oh, hello from inside a block!"
end 
```
