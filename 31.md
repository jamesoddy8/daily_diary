## JavaScript Arrow Functions: How, why and when (and when not) to use them

Arrow functions - sometimes called 'fat arrow' functions, utlize the token ```=>```.

JavaScript arrow functions are roughly the equivalent of blocks in Ruby. 

An arrown function expression is a syntactically compact alternative to a regular function expression, although without its oven bindings to the ```this```, ```arguments```, ```super```, or ```new.target``` keywords. Arrow function expressions are ill suited as methods, and they cannot be used as constructors. 

**Arrow Function Syntax** 

 

> Ruby reminder - A block is a piece of code that accepts arguments, and returns a value. A block is always passed to a method call.

```ruby
5.times do
  puts "Oh, hello from inside a block!"
end 
```

## Reading Beyond Your Level 

> Learn how to read reference and technical guide material 

**Sentences as maps**
We will start by exploring ```monads```. You won't understand them today, so don't worry too much about that. Just focus on learning the techniques. 

Consider this statement: 
> A mondad is a moniod in the category of endofunctors

This might feel very scary to read. "Oh no:, you might think, "I guess I will google for another resource..."/ 

Resist that impulse today. 

This sentence doesn't *explain* monads to us. That's why it feels unhelpful - but it does contain useful information. It tells us this: 

To understand monads we need to understand: 
* "monoids"
* "the category of endofunctors" 

Let's keep that list going. If we open up wikipedia it will tell us this about monoids: 

> A monoid is an algebraic structure with a single associative binary operation and an identity element. 

Again, scary. But this tells us that to understand monoids we need to understand: 
* "algebraic structures"
* "an associative binary operation"
* "an identity element" 

If we keep repeating this process we will eventually understand what monads are. 

This might take time, and there might be great shortcuts we can take by having someone explain something to us - which is great! But it's also great to know that you can always do it yourself if you need to. 

### new operator

The ```new``` operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function. The ```new``` keyword does the following things:

1. Creates a blank, plain JavaScript object;
2. Links (sets the constructor of) this object to another object;
3. Passes the newly created object from *Step 1* as the ```this``` context; 
4. Returns ```this``` if the function doesn't return its own object. 

Creating a user-defined object requires two steps:

1. Define the object type by writing a function. 
2. Create an instance of the object with ```new```.

To define an object type, create a function for the object type that specifies its name and properties. An object can have a property that is itself another object. See the examples below: 

When the code ```new Foo(...)``` is executed, the following things happen:

1. A new object is created, inheriting from ```Foo.prototype```. 
2. The constructor function ```Foo``` is called with the specified arguments, and with ```this``` bound to the newly created object. ```new Foo``` is equivalent
