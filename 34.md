# Callbacks and following the flow of control 

JavaScript higher - order functions are also known as Callback Functions. 

In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, that is, functions are of the type *Object* and they can be used in a first-class manner like any other object (String, Array, Number, etc) since they are in fact objects themselves. They can be "stored in variables, passed as arguments to functions, created within functions, and returned from functions." 

Because functions are first-class objects, we can pass a function as an argument in another function and later execute that passed-in function or even return it to be executed later. This is the essence of using callback functions in JavaScript. 

**Callback functions** are derived from a programming paradigm known as **functional programming**. At a fundamental level, functional programming specifies the use of functions as arguments. Functional programming was - and still is, though to a much lesser extent today - seen as an esoteric technique of specially trained, master programmers. 

### What is a Callback or Higher-order Function?

A callback function, aslo known as a higher-order function, is a function that is passed to another function (let's call this other function "otherFunction") as a parameter, and the callback function is called (or executed) inside the otherFunction. A callback function is essentially a pattern (an established solution to a common problem), and therefore, the use of a callback function is also known as a callback pattern. 

Consider this common use of a callback function in jQuery: 

```js
//Note that the item in the click method's parameter is a function, not a variable.
//The item is a callback function
$("#btn_1).click(function() {
  alert("Btn 1 Clicked"); 
});
```

As you can see in the preceding example, we pass a function as a parameter to the *click* method. And the click method will call (or execute) the callback function we passed to it. This example illustrates a typical us of callback functions in JavaScript, and one widely used in jQuery. 

Another example is the following: 

```js 
var friends = ["Mike", "Stacey", "Andy", "Rick"]; 

friends.forEach(function (eachName, index){
console.log(index + 1 + ". " + eachName); // 1. Mike, 2. Stacey, 3. Andy, 4. Rick
}); 

Again, note the way we pass an anoynmous function (a function without a name) to the forEach method as a parameter.
