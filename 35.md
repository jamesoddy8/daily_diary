# The DOM (Document Object Model) 

The Document Object Modelis the data representation of the objects that compromise the structure and content of a document on the web. 

### What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. 

It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. 

The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page. 

A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object MOdel (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript. 

The W3C DOM and WHATWG DOM standards are implemented in most modern browsers. Many browsers extend the standard, so care must be exercised when using them on the web where documents may be accessed by various browsers with different DOM's. 

For example, the standard DOM specifies that the getElementByTagName method in the code below must return a list of all the <p> elements in the document: 

```js 
const paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
//paragraphs[0] is the first <p> element
//paragraphs[1] is the second <p> element, etc. 
alert(paragraphs[0].nodeName);
```
All of the properties, methods, and events available for manipulating and creating web pages are organised into objects (for example, the ```document``` object that represents the document itself, the ```table``` object that implements the special ```HTMLTableElement``` DOM intergace for accessing HTML tables, and so forth).

The modern DOM is built using multiple API's that work together. The core DOM defines the objects that fundamentally describe a document and the objects within it. This is expanded upon as needed by other API's that add new features and capabilities to the DOM. For example, the HTML DOM API adds support for representing HTML documents to the core DOM. 

### DOM and JavaScript 

The example above is JavaScript. That is to say, it's *written* in JavaScript, but it *uses* the DOM to access the document and its elements. The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language would not have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, XML documents, and their component parts (e.g. elements). Every element in a document - the document as a whole, the head, tables within the document, table headers, text within the table cells - is part of the document object model for that document, so they can all be accessed and manipulated using the DOM and a scripting language like JavaScript. 

In the beginning, JavaScript and the DOM were intertwined, but eventually, they evolved into separate entities. The page content is stored in the DOM and may be accessed and manipulated via JavaScript, so that we may write this approximative equation: 

API = DOM + JavaScript 

The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API. Through we focus exclusively on JavaScript in this reference documentation, implementations of the DOM can be built for any language. 

### Accessing the DOM

Different browsers have different implementations of the DOM, and these implementations exhibit varying degrees of conformance to the actual DOM standard - every web browser uses some document object model to make web pages accessible via JavaScript. 

When a script is created whether it's inline in a <script> element or included in the web page by means of a script loading instruction - you can immediately begin using the API for the ```document``` or ```window``` elements to manipulate the document itself or to get at the children of that document, which are the various elements in the web page. Your DOM programming may be something as simple as the following, which displays an alert message by using the ```alert()``` function from the ```window``` object, or it may use more sophisticated DOM methods to actually create new content, as in the longer example below: 

This following JavaScript will display an alert when the document is loaded (and when the whole DOM is available for use): 

```html
<body onload="window.alert('Welcome to my home page!');">
```
Another example. This function creates a new H1 element, adds text to that element, and then adds the H1 to the tree for this document:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script> 
      // run this function when the document is loaded 
      window.onload = function() {
      
        // create a couple of elements in an otherwise empty HTML page
        const heading = document.createElement("h1"); 
        const heading_text = document.createTextNode("Big Head!"); 
        heading.appendChild(heading_text);
        document.body.appendChild(heading); 
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
