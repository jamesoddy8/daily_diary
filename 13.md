## Params (continued)

### Query String Params 

Query string parameters are passed to the application through the address bar, using a ? as so: 

``` http://localhost:9393/whatsup?name=bruce&surname=wayne ```

The application can handle these params in the controller as follows: 

```ruby 
get '/whatsup' do
  "Whats up " + params[:name] + " " + params[:surname]"
end
```

Query String params are fantastic because they allow you to have descriptive URLs

### $ global variables

If you haven't picked this up by now, use of global variables is pretty much Ruby blasphemy, because they can easily crash your program. Since we don't know much about databases, we're allowing this horrible sin in exchange for simplified learning. But don't use them outside of this week. Please.

### URL Path Parameters

These parameters are passed to the application as a part of the URL Path: 

``` http://localhost:9393/hello/clark/kent ```

This can then be handles in the controller as follows: 

```ruby 
get '/hello/:name/:surname' do
  "Hello " + params[:name] + " " + params[:surname]"
end
```

It is important to note that, unlike query string params, path params are sequential - that is, they have to appear in the URL in the order prescribed in the controller.

Path params are great because they allow you to have descriptive paths that can be even be edited directly by the user. For a great example of this, check out Kayak.com - when you search for a flight, they use path params to display the result, e.g.

```http://www.kayak.co.uk/flights/LON-SIN/2015-01-16/2015-02-12```

### Splat Parameters

Splat params are similar to Path params, but they use the wildcard ```*``` as a placeholder for anything. 

Consider this URL: 

```http://localhost:9393/say/hello/to/snoopy```

And this controller?

```ruby 
get '/say/*/to/*' do
  params[:splat][0] + ' ' + params[:splat][1] + '!'
end

# => 'hello snoopy!'
``` 

Sinatra will actually take the splat values and put them into an array that is stored in the params hash. So in this case, params would look something like this: 

```{:splat => ['hello', 'snoopy']}```
