## Params (continued)

### Query String Params 

Query string parameters are passed to the application through the address bar, using a ? as so: 

``` http://localhost:9393/whatsup?name=bruce&surname=wayne ```

The application can handle these params in the controller as follows: 

```ruby 
get '/whatsup' do
  "Whats up " + params[:name] + " " + params[:surname]"
end
```

Query String params are fantastic because they allow you to have descriptive URLs



If you haven't picked this up by now, use of global variables is pretty much Ruby blasphemy, because they can easily crash your program. Since we don't know much about databases, we're allowing this horrible sin in exchange for simplified learning. But don't use them outside of this week. Please.
