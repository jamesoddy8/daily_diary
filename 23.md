# Encapsulation with the constructor and prototype pattern

Things are done differently in javascript
Not really a direct equivalence of classes
New class keyword is syntactic sugar

```js
// spec/thermostatSpec.js

  it('starts at 20 degrees', function() {
    expect(thermostat.getCurrentTemperature()).toEqual(20);
  });
```

Notice how we place parenthesis at the end. Why? This is to communicate to the JavaScript interpreter that we want it to execute this function, as opposed to returning the function itself.
